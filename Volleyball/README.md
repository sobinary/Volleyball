Deception

You know that your enemy bases his strategy on his observations of you. 

Behavior = (e as Environment Set , a as Action Set)

If you give a false behavior B instead of your real behavior B*, upon observing B.e,  
they will assume you will apply B.a[i]; they will then play P most hurtful to B.a[i].
Knowing this, you will instead prepare yourself with the play P* that counters P
the best.
